Simple Landing is a clean, responsive coming soon landing page built with Bootstrap. It was built for businesses and developers. 

It has a countdown timer and jquery validated php email form. Both are super simple to change. Just change a few numbers and add your own email address and you're off!

It will only take you a few minutes to set up this template and have a splash page for your upcoming project.

Email form:

To change the email form go to line 90 and change this line of code:
$to = "youremailaddress@email.com";

Countdown Timer:

Go to line 140 and change this line:
var liftoffTime = new Date(2012, 6 - 1, 22, 11, 00);
