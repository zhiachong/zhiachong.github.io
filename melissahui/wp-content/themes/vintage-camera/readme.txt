Vintage Camera is a snazzy microblogging theme for the camera enthusiast.

Vintage Camera supports all WordPress post formats and includes six different theme styles--Brownie, Diana, Polaroid, Sabre, Savoy and K1000 (default). It also supports an optional responsive layout for small screens, custom flyout menus, three widget areas in the footer, custom header and background.

As Vintage Camera is designed to be a microblog-style theme, page navigation does not show by default. However, if you'd like page navigation, simply create a custom menu under Appearance -> Menus and assign it to the Navigation area. This will create a navigation bar at the bottom of the site.

Google Web fonts used are Sansita One, Alegreya and Trochut.

Camera illustrations included with this theme were created by me and licensed under the GPL.
