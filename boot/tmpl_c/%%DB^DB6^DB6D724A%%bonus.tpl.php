        <blockquote>A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work. <em>Colin Powell</em></blockquote>
<p>
 We believe that everyone deserves to be rewarded for their hard work, and at Inflex Shares, we take that belief to another level -- we are awarding <b>you</b>, our trusted investors with a bonus every weekend. This is a brand new system that hasn't been implemented before, so let it be known that we are treading on uncharted waters here, but we believe this will lead to newer and greater heights.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <b>Every Friday</b> . <b>0.5 - 2.5%</b> . <b>Guaranteed</b><br/><br/>
 <em>How does it work?</em>
 <br/>
 We are giving out a small bonus, the amount is chosen at our own discretion, to all our investors every Friday. The bonus will be dependent on several factors, some of which include, but not limited to, the total deposit for the week, the total withdrawal for the week, our trade results and also marketing efforts. 
 <br/>
 <br/>
 While we know that everyone enjoys a small bonus as a form of reward every now and then, we sincerely hope that this will not turn into a <i>speculationary war</i>, where investors start taking the bonus award in face value and speculate the financial and overall health of our team. We should clarify that the bonus is simply an award for investors for a week well done. Nothing more, nothing less. Please do not panic if the bonus appears to be lower or higher than the previous week, this is absolutely normal. As we grow, we will incur expenses along the way. Therefore, in view of such situations, sometimes we might have to lower the bonus to pay for these expenses. Nevertheless, the bonus will never be a negative award -- we won't take money from your balance to pay for these expenses!
 <br/>
 <br/>
 We can't emphasize enough how important it is for everyone to stick together as a family at Inflex Shares, because we are going for the long run here, and everyone's help is needed.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>
  <em>How much?</em>
  <br/>
  The bonus will range from 0.5 - 2.5%. While we want to award our investors, it's also important to keep in mind that we want to have a steady cash flow. We have many plans in mind, and as we roll them out, we will definitely incur expenses along the way.
  <br/>
  </p>
<p>
  <em>Who?</em>
  <br/>
  Everyone who has an active deposit in Inflex Shares will be eligible for this bonus. If, for some reason, you did not receive the bonus, please make sure to contact our support staff for more information. 
</p>
<p>
<em>Why?</em>
<br/>
  Simple. As we stated earlier in our statement, we want you to earn as well. We really wish to help everyone succeed. It brings joy to our hearts when we see that every single person who joins us in our mission becomes financially independent. The financial industry sank into a turmoil a couple of years ago, and it became painfully evident to us that something needs to be done to change it. That's why we came up with Inflex Shares. We believe we have the solution, and we want you to be a part of it.
