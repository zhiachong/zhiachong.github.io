        <br/>
        <p>We are a team of professionals who have been focusing on BitCoin and Forex trading primarily for the past 5 years. We looked at BitCoin as one of the most promising decentralized currencies in the world around 3 years ago, and started purchasing those coins at an aggressive pace when they were selling at close to $1 per BitCoin. Today, they're worth about $1000. Don't take our words for it -- take a look <a href="http://www.mtgox.com" alt="Mt. Gox">here</a>. As such, we found ourselves in a very conducive position to offer our investment strategies to the rest of the world.
</p>
<p>
 Every single day, thousands of people lose their money in the stock market. <br/><br/><em>The reason?</em> <b>Greed</b> . <b>Inexperience</b> . <b>Haste</b>.<br/><br/>
 If there's anything we learned from experience, we need to be able to time the market well, and be able to observe the ups and downs of the market. For example, with BitCoins, we saw few years ago that the market for BitCoins would soar well over what it's worth now, so we purchased aggressively and held them because we knew the <i>inherent</i> worth of these assets. Some might call them "speculative assets", but we prefer to call these <i>"money cows"</i>. How often do you find an asset that gives you over 10000% return in only a few years?  
</p>
<p>
Inflex Shares was formed for the sole purpose of meeting demands of our fellow investors. We keep hearing others who want to join in on our ventures, and they've consistently failed to even achieve half of our target returns each year. Therefore, we decided, as a team, to offer this brand new attractive opportunity to others so that they may achieve our success as well.
</p>
<p>
<em>Why do we do it?</em> Simple. We want you to earn as well. When you earn, we earn a small commission. So with that said, everytime you make a $100, we take a small commission from the trades, and we both win in this situation. 
</p>
<p>
<em>Why invest with us?</em> In the untrained eyes, we are just <i>another</i> group of money managers who are sucking your money and making a profit in the process. But we aren't interested in making a few pennies, or a few hundred bucks from your hard-earned money. We want <b>you</b> to earn as we earn, because we believe the money market isn't a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_sum_game'>zero sum game.</a> We believe there's enough money circulating in the world for everyone, and everyone deserves an opportunity to achieve financial freedom.
